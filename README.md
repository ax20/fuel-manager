# **Data Manager**
 A web app that tracks and manages data, for example managing fuel efficency and tracking the estimated amount of calories burned in a month by calculating the time spent at the gym.

# Project Goal
> *Understanding RESTful API's and expanding knowledge with Flask and ReactJS to improve my full stack development skills.* 

 ## Technologies
 - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (*Flask is known for it's speed and ease of scalability, as well as it's easy to use rendering methods. I have been studying Python for a long time as well so this was the perfect oppurtunity to put my skills to the test.*)
 - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) (*Very popular in the frontend community, I have seen ReactJS mentioned everywhere and I knew I had to learn it at somepoint, so why not with a bigger project that has real world uses.*)
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (*A newer SQL database system that is recently been gaining popularity, the UI is much cleaner and interactive with the system is easier than MySQL so I decided to go with it. The icon also looks cool*)

## Skills
- Full-Stack Development
- Building RESTful API's
- Database Management
- Structual Project Design
- Github Projects
- Node.js
